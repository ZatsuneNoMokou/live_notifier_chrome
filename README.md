# Live notifier (Portage Chrome)
Firefox addon to be notified of streams from Dailymotion, Hitbox and Twitch

Currently, it's a comma separated list. The id is the dailymotion video key (for exemple, for this one http://games.dailymotion.com/live/x313o13 the id is x313o13. If the streamer have his/her own page where the dailymotion player is embed, but the url after the dailymotion key, separating it with a space.

Same thing for Hitbox and Twitch, except that you need the id/name. For exemple, for this one http://www.hitbox.tv/Laet-It-Be the id is Laet-It-Be, for http://www.twitch.tv/krayn_live the id is krayn_live.

You can import the streams you follow with Hitbox and Twitch entering you ID and clicking on Import.

The second setting let you choose delay between checks, in minutes. By default, it update status every 5min.
